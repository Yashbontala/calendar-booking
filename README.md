## Design & Assumptions

1.Time slots are always 60 minutes long.

2.Availabilities are per-date (a date cannot have overlapping times).

3.No authentication is implemented â€” assumed the owner is authenticated.

4.In-memory repository (no persistence). Can be replaced with a DB by implementing BookingRepository.
